- <span style="color: Red;">Using Classes</span>

  - Create two paragraph with different classes (`blue`, `red`) and define classes in style tag
  - It don't need it to put class attribute closing tag
  - By removing tag name before dot notation it can be apply on all tags which have a specific class attribute

  - ![](Images/8.png)
  -
  - RGB colors
  - ![](Images/9.png)
  - Check this colors in windows paint
  - Use `rgb(number for red, number for green, number for blue);` property
  - It's better to use hex-code color code. It's more professional
  - Use for ex: `#ff2456` format for apply color on your tags numbers in hex-code cover around 16 million different color `00..ff`

- <span style="color: Red;">Inline Style Sheet</span>

  - Even `body` tag is surrounded by Box model
  - Bay adding temporary border you can check box around a element

  - HTML elements come in top-down order
  - By setting `margin-left` and `margin-right` to `auto` our element become centralized
  - Add border and background to our image

  - Color of background applies on the padding
  - Set margin to 0 and check other elements margin
